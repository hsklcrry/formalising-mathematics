# Introduction to G-modules in Lean

Let `G` be a group (with group law `*`) and let `M` be an abelian
group (with group law `+`). A `G`-action on `M` is just a group
homomorphism from `G` to the group automorphisms
of `M`, or in other words an action `•` of `G` on `M` (in the sense
of groups acting on sets/types) satisfying
the axiom `smul_add g m n : g • (m + n) = g • m + g • n`.

The goal of this workshop will be to set up a cohomology theory
for G-modules. We will just do H⁰ (G-invariant elements)
and H¹ (1-cocycles modulo coboundaries), but clearly one
could go on to 2-cocycles, n-cocycles etc.

### typeclass comments ("will it work for monoids/add_monoids?")

Note that the definition of G-module does not mention `g⁻¹` at all, so
we can even define it for monoids `G`, which we will. Loads
of the theory works for `G` a monoid in fact (certainly everything
we do in this workshop). But we use subtraction on `M` quite a
lot in practice when we get to `H¹` (e.g. the coboundary `g b - b`
needs subtraction) so I've assumed that `M` is an abelian group throughout for
pedagogical reasons (and because it solved some typeclass issue at some point).

The `G`-module structure on `M` is called `distrib_mul_action G M` in Lean.

## The interface for G-modules, i.e. the theory of `•`

In Lean we learn about the typeclass `[distrib_mul_action G M]`, 
which gives us the notation `•` for an action of `G` on `M`,
and all the axioms.

Notation for this section:

Let `G` be a group. Let `M` be an abelian group and furthermore
assume `M` is a `G`-module. We use the usual notation `(g₁ * g₂) • (m₁ + m₂)`

-- elements of `M`.

/-

### The interface for `•`

Below are the names of the theorem proofs which you will need
to know when manipulating an element of a fixed `G`-module,
for example the element `(g₁ * g₂) • (m₁ + m₂)`.

I have explained the names of the proofs in the form
of examples. The syntax for the examples is this:

`example : <Theorem statement> := <name of proof function> input1 input2 ...`

So these examples tell you the names of the proofs of the theorems.
The proofs are functions which need inputs, and the inputs are
the variables used in the theorem statement. I also mention
whether Lean's "rw-machine" (the `simp` tactic) knows about these theorems.

-/

example : g • (0 : M) = 0 := smul_zero g -- a simp lemma
example : g • (m₁ + m₂) = g • m₁ + g • m₂ := smul_add g m₁ m₂ -- a simp lemma 
example : g • (-m) = -(g • m) := smul_neg g m -- a simp lemma
example : (1 : G) • m = m := one_smul G m -- a simp lemma
example : g • (m₁ - m₂) = g • m₁ - g • m₂ := smul_sub g m₁ m₂ -- at the time of writing not a simp lemma
example : (g₁ * g₂) • m = g₁ • g₂ • m := mul_smul g₁ g₂ m -- not a simp lemma

-- try some examples for yourself.
example : (g1 * g2) • (m1 + m2) = g1 • g2 • m1 + g1 • g2 • m2 :=
begin
  rw mul_smul g1 g2 (m1 + m2),
  simp,
end

example : (1 * 1 * 1 : G) • m = m :=
begin
  simp,
end 

end distrib_mul_action_stuff

/-

### Entirely optional digression on `simp`

Some of those lemmas above were "simp lemmas" (if you `#print one_smul`
you'll see it has a `@[simp]` tag). What makes a good simp lemma?

The most important rule is that, unless you really know what you're
doing, it should be of the form `A = B` or `A ↔ B`.

The second rule is that the right hand side should in some sense
be "simpler than" the left hand side.
so the lemma should say `A simplifies_to B`, indicating a flow towards
a solution.

For example `one_mul : 1 * a = a` is a `simp` lemma for groups (and
for monoids), because it is an equality, and the right hand side
is unarguably simpler than the left hand side. 

Later on we'll be making some of our own structures, and
we will want to train Lean's simplifier to use those structures. The better
you understand how the simplifier works on your structures, the easier you
will find it to type "mathematics as the mathematician thinks about it"
into Lean.

-/

### The `simp` tactic

A lemma is, by definition, a `simp` lemma, if its proof term is tagged
with the `@[simp]` attribute (you can check a term's attributes with `#print`)

`simp` is an algorithm which will "follow its nose", doing
stuff like expanding out brackets automatically and tidying up.
It would tidy up by simplifying `g • 0` to `0` for example,
and it would expand out by changing `g • (m₁ + m₂)` to `g • m₁ + g • m₂`.
In general `simp` tries to rewrite equivalences, e.g. things of the
form `A = B` or `A ↔ B`, with in each case `B` the "simplified" or
"expanded out" version of `A`. The equivalences it rewrites
with are the ones in its database of a few thousand (*shrug?)
so-called "`simp` lemmas" For example, if `⇑0 : G → M` is the
zero function then `zero_val g : ⇑0 g = 0` would be a good `simp`
lemma, which is why it is tagged with the `@[simp]` attribute,
making it part of the database.

Note that `simp` does not have "ideas". It will never apply
commutativity or associativity, for example, for fear that
it might be a waste of time which would have to be undone later.
`simp` will solve `x + 0 = x` but it will not solve `m + n = n + m`,
because it is not so clear that the right hand side is any simpler
than the left hand side. problems like that you need `abel`.

To learn more about `simp`, check out the simp docs on
the leanprover-community website.
-- TODO when online -- add link to simp docs in API at leanprover-community website

## A note on `abel`

`abel` should be able to solve all problems in abelian groups
of the form ∀ a b c, a + (c + -b) = (a - b) + c etc.
Note however that it *cannot use hypotheses*. It will only
prove identities which are true in all abelian groups. 

-/
example (M : Type) [add_comm_group M] (a b c : M) :
  a + (c + -b) = (a - b) + c := by abel

/-
## The interface for morphisms of G-modules, i.e. the theory of `→+[_]`

Lean uses notation `M →+[G] N` and name `distrib_mul_action_hom`,
but you don't need to remember the name, it should work in the 
background for you.

The type of G-module homs from `M` to `N`, i.e. the set
that a mathematician would call something like $$\Hom_G(M,N)$$,
is in Lean called `M →+[G] N`. The non-notation name for this function
type is `distrib_mul_action_hom G M N`, which is why you see this word in
namespaces or mentioned in sections.

Terms of this type are `G`-module morphisms from `M` to `N`.
So when we see `φ : M →+[G] N` it means that `φ` is a G-module hom
from `M` to `N`. We will often only be using `φ` only in terms of its
associated function `⇑φ : M → N`. `φ` itself is a package, consisting
of a function and a bunch of theorems about that function.

-/

namespace distrib_mul_action_hom

/-

### API for `M →+[G] N`

Here are the names of the proofs of the basic axioms for G-module
morphisms. The proofs are in the `→+[_]` namespace, so you can
write things like `φ.map_smul` to access them easily.

-/
example : φ (g • m) = g • (φ m) := φ.map_smul g m -- a simp lemma
example (m₁ m₂ : M) : φ (m₁ + m₂) = φ m₁ + φ m₂ := φ.map_add m₁ m₂ -- a simp lemma

example : φ (g • (m₁ + m₂)) = g • φ m₁ + g • φ m₂ :=
begin
  simp,
end

## A G-module morphism is a pair of things

A G-module morphism `φ : M →+[G] N` is two things.
1) a function `⇑φ : M → N`
2) the dot notation system for `φ`, a database where
all the axioms and theorems for G-module homs as applied to `φ` are stored.

For example, the type of φ.map_smul is *actually* a theorem about `⇑φ`.

`φ.map_smul g m : ⇑φ (g • m) = g • ⇑φ m`


-/

example (φ : M →+[G] N) : φ 0 = 0 :=
begin
  -- library_search will take some time (I don't know why)
  -- but will eventually find the answer to this one. 
  -- But you can guess it quicker!
  -- what will you rewrite?
  exact φ.map_zero,
end

-- Can you solve it in term mode like in those earlier examples?
example : φ 0 = 0 := φ.map_zero

-- Can you change `sorry` to the name of a tactic?
example : φ 0 = 0 := by exact φ.map_zero

/-

### Composition of G-module morphisms

You know how to compose functions, you just write `ψ (φ a)`
or whatever. Composition in the category of G-modules is
done with the `comp` method for `G`-module morphisms.

-/

-- let P be another G-module
variables {P : Type} [add_comm_monoid P] [distrib_mul_action G P]

-- Recall `φ : M →+[G] N` from earlier.
-- let ψ : N → P be another G-module morphism
variable (ψ : N →+[G] P) -- his is notation for `ψ : distrib_mul_action_hom G N P`

-- let's make function composition notation
infixr ` ∘ᵍ `:90 := distrib_mul_action_hom.comp

-- how to compose G-module maps
example : M →+[G] P := ψ ∘ᵍ φ

-- You should think of φ and ψ as morphisms in the category
-- of `G`-modules. They are functions, but they also have
-- some extra category-theoretic baggage (proofs that they
-- are G-linear maps) which needs to be moved around.

-- KB NOTE TO SELF do we ever actually compose morphisms?
-- My definition of short exact sequence of G-modules
-- is "image = kernel" , which is highly category-theoretic.
-- and functional evaluation often takes place after that.

-- The important fact is that `(ψ ∘ φ) m = ψ (φ m)`, as
-- terms of type `P`. Rather nicely, this theorem is called
-- `ψ.comp_apply` but it is also a `simp` lemma, and 
-- furthermore true by definition
example (m : M) :
  (ψ ∘ᵍ φ) m = ψ (φ m) := ψ.comp_apply φ m -- and `rfl` works too and `by simp`

example (m : M) :
  -- normal function composition
  (ψ ∘ φ) m = ψ (φ m) := ψ.comp_apply φ m -- and `rfl` works too and `by simp`

-- By the way, `squeeze_simp` is a version of `simp` which tells you 
-- which rewrites it did. Give it a try!
example :
  (ψ ∘ᵍ φ) (g • (m1 + m2)) = g • (ψ (φ m1) + ψ (φ m2)) :=
begin
  simp only [map_add, comp_apply, map_smul],
end

### Mathematicians have more than one "definition" of `is_exact`

Of course exactness means the image is the kernel, of course it
means for every n, n is in the image iff n is in the kernel,
and of course it means `∀ n : N, (∃ m : M, φ m = n) ↔ ψ n` because
to a mathematician all of these ideas are *the same thing*.

In Lean some of these things are definitionally equal, some
equivalences involve coercions, some use set extensionality.
But we need to make sure that we offer the mathematician all
possible useful definitions of being "true by definition" .

## Making an API for short exact sequences.

This is just basic logic and should be accessible to anyone who knows
the mathematics and has played the natural number game.

-/
open function

-- here is the docstring for short exact sequences

/--
Fundamental to cohomology theory is the concept of a short
exact sequence. If `φ : M →+[G] N` and
`ψ : N →+[G] P` are G-module morphisms, `is_short_exact φ ψ` 
is the proposition stating that `0 → M -φ→ N -ψ→ P → 0` is short exact
in the usual sense, that is:

*) `φ` is injective, 
*) the range of `φ` equals the kernel of `ψ`,
*) `ψ` is surjective. 

If `h : is_short_exact φ ψ` then you can access various standard
facts about `φ` and `ψ` using dot notation with `h`. For example
`h.injective` is the proof that `φ` is injective, and 
`h.exact_set` is the proof of some expanded-out version of the
statement that an element `n` is in the image
of `φ` if and only if it is in the kernel of `ψ`. A rather more
compact definition is `h.exact_cat`.

### Some more API for short exact sequences.

It's convenient to define a noncomputable function using axiom of choice,
which is a random splitting of the surjection ψ : P → N and hence a
one-sided inverse. We will need such a function when doing boundary maps.
We call this function `inverse_ψ` and prove `ψ (inverse_ψ p) = p` .
We also define `inverse_φ` -- given `n : N` and a proof that 
it's in the image of `φ`, I pull back `n` to some explicit `inverse_φ n : M`
and prove `φ (inverse_φ n) = n`. 

This use of the axiom of choice is a bit delicate so I'll do it.
